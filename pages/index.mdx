## `langfuse` overview

> Debug and improve your LLM-based application by logging/analyzing all user interactions, backend traces, and explicit/implicit user feedback.

**Features**

1. Data collection
   - Tracing LLM application, chain, agent via backend SDK
   - Scoring of traces based on user feedback/interaction via frontend SDKs
2. Data exploration in langfuse UI
   - Identify issues
   - Debug LLM application

**Architecture**

- Server ([cloud](/docs/cloud), [local](/docs/local), [self-hosted](/docs/self-host))
  - API server on top database
  - Web app to explore data
- [Client SDKs](/docs/sdk) to integrate with LLM application
  - Backend SDK for tracing
  - Frontend SDK for scoring of traces based on user feedback/interaction

## Why are we building `langfuse`?

1. **Situation:** LLMs introduce a _'black box'_ character to Software Engineering: outputs of LLM-based applications are unpredictable
2. **Problem:** Quality of application in production cannot be assured with testing before launching the feature
3. **Consequence:** Engineers need to embrace active learning from users in production to improve their LLM-based applications. Many teams build UX around their LLM-based application to make the imperfect outputs usable and to collect feedback from users.
4. **Need:** Holistic tracing of what happens in production, linked to user feedback and other signals to understand how to improve the application.

--> `langfuse` helps with exactly that

## Roadmap

- [x] MVP: API server for collecting traces, scores, and basic UI to explore data, runs locally or self-hosted
- [x] [SDKs](/docs/sdk) for tracing and scoring, typescript and python
- [x] [Docs](/docs) and walkthrough (v1) ([video](#walkthrough-3-min), [repo](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-demo))
- [x] [Dashboard](/docs/interface#dashboard) to explore data
- [x] Authentication and authorization on project level in UI, API, SDKs
- [x] [langfuse cloud](/docs/cloud) to simplify setup
- [ ] Model-based evaluation of traces and LLM calls
- [ ] Pre-built SDK functions for best-practice scoring
- [ ] Tracing integration with frameworks, e.g. langchain
- [ ] API to retrieve few-shot examples based on embedding similarity to current prompt
- [ ] LLM playground to interactively adapt prompts based on production examples
