# Prompt Management

Use Langfuse to effectively manage and version your prompts. This allows you to iterate quickly, publish new prompt versions without redeploying your app, and track metrics by version.

## How to use Langfuse for prompt management

<Callout type="info">

This feature is currently in beta, the API is stable and performance/UI will be improved significantly over the next weeks. Please share your feedback on our [Discord](/discord).

The workflow for managing prompts in Langfuse includes the following steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["1. Create new prompt version (SDK or UI)"] --> PV
    subgraph S1["Prompt (identified by name)"]
        PV["Prompt Version"] -->|"2. Promote"| PP["Production Prompt"]
    end
    PP --> D["3. Retrieve prompt using SDK"]
    PP --> E["4. View Metrics in Langfuse for prompt version"]
```

## Performance

While [Langfuse Tracing](/docs/tracing) is fully asynchronous and non-blocking, managing prompts in Langfuse adds latency to your application when retrieving the prompt. Currently the prompt is retrieved from the Langfuse API every time you fetch it via the SDKs. We will introduce caching in future releases to reduce the performance impact.

**Quick performance measurement**

We measured the execution time of the following snippet (retrieval and prompt compilation):

```python
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("perf-test")
prompt.compile(input="test")
```

Results from 1000 sequential executions:
