# Debugging UI

LLM apps use increasingly complex abstractions (chains, agents with tools, advanced prompts). Our debugging UI helps to understand what is going on and get to the root cause of problems.

<Image
  alt="Debugging UI screenshot"
  src={debuggingUiImage}
  style={{ objectFit: "contain" }}
  className="max-h-[650px] mt-3"
/>

## Combine with user feedback

If you collect user feedback via the Langfuse SDK (or ingest it via the API), you can easily filter down to production executions that had poor quality. You can then use the debugging UI to get to the root cause of the problem.
