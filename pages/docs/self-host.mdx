# Self-Hosting Instructions

If you want to run `langfuse` in your infrastructure, you can easily generate a Docker container.

## 1. Postgres database

You need to have a permanent Postgres database to persist the state of `langfuse`. You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or you can run it yourself. After setting it up, copy the connection string.

## 2. Create docker image from repository

```bash copy
# clone the repo and cd into the directory
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git && cd langfuse

# create the env file and add your postgres connection string
cp .env.dev.example .env

# build the container
docker build -t langfuse .
```

## 3. Deploy the container

Deploy the container to your infrastructure. You can use a managed service like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or you can run it yourself.

```bash copy
docker run -p 3030:3000 langfuse
```

## Update the application

If you want to update the application, you can simply rebuild the container and redeploy it.

```bash copy
# pull the latest changes
git pull
# rebuild the container
docker build -t langfuse .
```
