The fastest way to get started is to use the Langfuse Cloud. Alternatively you can run langfuse locally to test it out or self-host it.

<Tabs items={["langfuse cloud", "local", "self-hosted"]}>
  <Tab>
    <RunCloud />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <RunLocal />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <RunSelfHost />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
